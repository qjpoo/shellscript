#   The lp and lpr Commands
#
#   The command lp or lpr prints a file onto paper as opposed to 
# the screen display. Once you are ready with formatting using pr 
# command, you can use any of these commands to print your file 
# on printer connected with your computer.
#
#
#   The lpstat and lpq Commands
#
#   The lpstat command shows what's in the printer queue: request 
# IDs, owners, file sizes, when the jobs were sent for printing, 
# and the status of the requests.
#
#
#	The cancel and lprm Commands
#
#   The cancel terminates a printing request from the lp command. 
# The lprm terminates lpr requests. You can specify either the ID 
# of the request (displayed by lp or lpq) or the name of the printer.
